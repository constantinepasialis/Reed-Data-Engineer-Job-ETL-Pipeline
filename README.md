# Reed-Data-Engineer-Job-ETL-Pipeline
"Reed Data Engineer Job ETL Pipeline" is an ETL project that extracts job listings for Data Engineer positions from Reed's job portal. The pipeline transforms the raw data by filtering and organizing job details such as job title, company name, location, salary, job type, link and then loads the structured information into a database.
